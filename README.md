# Sammy's Lily58 Pro Build
#### Currently includes 2 OLEDs, LED strips, and acrylic case (design files included)

## Preface
I jumped into this project as a total novice. No soldering experience, no previous keyboard building experience. I hadn't even added custom keycaps to a keyboard before. 
While there are several Lily58 guides online, I found at least a couple of tiny but crucial details missing from each one. These guides are all extremely helpful and led to me completing this build, but are usually made by vendors or people with some amount of prior experience. I hope this guide serves to bridge that little gap between those guides and someone who is a complete noob and prone to making a multitude of mistakes along the way - as one does when embarking on a complex hobby for the first time!
