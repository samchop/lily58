# Sammy's Lily58 Pro Build for Beginners
*Hot-swappable and currently includes OLEDs, LED strips, and acrylic case (design files included)*

## Intro
Hey friends, in this guide we're going to walk through how I built a Lily58 Pro. I jumped into this project as a total novice. No soldering experience, no previous keyboard building experience. I hadn't even added custom keycaps to a keyboard before. 

While there are several extremely helpful Lily58 guides online, I found at least a couple of tiny but crucial details missing from each one. These are usually made by vendors or people with some amount of prior experience. I hope this guide serves to bridge the gap between those guides and someone who is a complete noob. To do that, I'm gonna painstakingly document my second build and share all the things I've learned between these two journeys.

## Phase 1 - PCB Build
### Materials 
| # | Name | Links | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| **2** | Lily58 Pro HotSwap PCBs | Github | *I had great results printing PCBs through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), but see the vendor list below for stores that sell kits and pcbs.*
| **2** | Pro Micro USB-Cs | Aliexpress, Amazon | *We'll be using the USB-C version in this guide, but feel free to use a regular Pro Micro* |
| **58** | switch sockets (MX or choc switch sockets) | Amazon, MKUltra | *Get MX for regular profile keys, choc for low-profile keys* |
| **58** | diodes (1N4148W) | Amazon |
| **2** | tactile switch (2-pin, 6mm x 3.5mm x 4.3mm) | Amazon |
| **2** | 3.5mm audio jack female socket (4-pin) | Amazon |
| **2** | OLED modules (128mm x 32mm) | Aliexpress |
| **1** | TRRS cable (4-pole cable) | Aliexpress, Amazon |
| **1** | USB-C cable with data transfer | Amazon | *Some are for charging only, please check. Get a micro-USB cable instead if you're using a regular Pro Micro* |
| **58** | switches of your choice | | *Remember to match the switches and caps with the sockets you choose. Most switches and keycaps use MX sockets, but low-profile keys and switches will use choc sockets.* |
| **58** | keycaps of your choice | 

The **Materials** list above includes the exact number of items needed for the build, and most kits include only the exact amount, but I highly recommend having extras on hand if you're a beginner. Or at least, be prepared that you might totally bork some pieces and need to start fresh.

I messed up an entire PCB board, multiple sockets, and fried a Pro Micro before getting this down. I do recommend practicing soldering beforehand if you can, but if you're anywhere as neurodivergent as I am the first board WILL be the practice, lol. That said, if you mess up, try to correct and salvage as much as possible. The right side of my board I thought I had ruined since I could not get a whole row to work for the life of me. But after carefully cleaning the pcb, removing some solder and redoing a few diodes it is now working perfectly.

### Tools

| Name | Links | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Soldering Iron| | *I ended up caving and buying a Hakko setup. Pricey but so nice to use, I recommend if you think you are going to be doing many more DIY builds* |
| Steel wool sponge | | *For cleaning the iron tip* |
| Damp regular sponge | | *Also for cleaning iron tip* | 
| Tweezers| | *The diodes are the most annoying little microshits ever, trust me you don't want to handle them without these. Plus I'm positive you will burn yourself.* |
| Soldering wire | | *I HIGHLY recommend using leaded wire, the lead-free wire that came with my soldering kit was awful. I thought it was just me being bad it it, but things became much more smooth-sailing after getting some 60/40 leaded soldering wire* |
| Well-lit work area | | *You don't wanna be straining yourself into a headache trying to find the faint lines on the microshits* |
| Ventilation | | *Do not breathe the solder fumes my friend.* |
