# Sammy's Lily58 Pro Build for Beginners
### *Hot-swappable and currently includes OLEDs, LED strips, and acrylic case (design files included)*

## Preface
I jumped into this project as a total novice. No soldering experience, no previous keyboard building experience. I hadn't even added custom keycaps to a keyboard before. 

While there are several Lily58 guides online, I found at least a couple of tiny but crucial details missing from each one. These guides are all extremely helpful and led to me completing this build, but are usually made by vendors or people with some amount of prior experience. I hope this guide serves to bridge that little gap between those guides and someone who is a complete noob and prone to making a multitude of mistakes along the way - as one does when embarking on any hobby for the first time!

## Phase 1 - PCB Build
### Materials 
| # | Name | Links | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| **2** | Lily58 PCBs | Github | *I had great results printing PCBs through [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), but see the vendor list below for stores that sell kits and pcbs.*
| **2** | Pro Micro USB-Cs | Aliexpress, Amazon | *We'll be using the USB-C version in this guide, but feel free to use a regular Pro Micro* |
| **58** | switch sockets (MX or choc switches) | Amazon, MKUltra | *Get MX for regular profile keys, choc for low-profile keys* |
| **58** | diodes (1N4148W) | Amazon |
| **2** | tactile switch (2-pin, 6mm x 3.5mm x 4.3mm) | Amazon |
| **2** | 3.5mm audio jack female socket (4-pin) | Amazon |
| **2** | OLED modules (128mm x 32mm) | Aliexpress |
| **1** | TRRS cable (4-pole cable) | Aliexpress, Amazon |
| **1** | USB-C cable with data transfer | Amazon | *Some are for charging only, please check. Get a micro-USB cable instead if you're using a regular Pro Micro* |

The **Materials** list above includes the exact number of items needed for the build, and most kits include only the exact amount, but I highly recommend having extras on hand if you're a beginner. Or at least, be prepared that you might totally bork some pieces and need to start fresh.

I messed up an entire PCB board, multiple sockets, and fried a Pro Micro before getting this down. I do recommend practicing soldering beforehand if you can, but if you're anywhere as neurodivergent as I am the first board WILL be the practice, lol. That said, if you mess up, try to correct and salvage as much as possible. The right side of my board I thought I had ruined since I could not get a whole row to work for the life of me. But after carefully cleaning the pcb, removing some solder and redoing a few diodes it is now working perfectly.

### Tools
- Soldering Iron
- Steel wool sponge (for cleaning iron tip)
- Damp regular sponge (also for cleaning iron tip)
- Tweezers (The diodes are the most annoying little microshits ever, trust me you don't want to handle them without these. Plus I'm positive you will burn yourself.)
- Solder wire

I first used the lead-free soldering wire that came with my soldering iron kit, it was awful. I thought it was just me being awful at doing this but this stuff just really sucks and is hard to work with.
